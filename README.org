** what it is

It is an app that approaches the machine learning analysis of Bangladeshi people's living standard.

With a view to achieving this goal, a huge dataset was collected beforehand and was eventually made suitable for the analysis.

The analysis doesn't focus on only a single ML algorithm. It undertakes 5 ML algorithms that include ensemble and tree type algorithms as well and eventually the dataset was trained with all the algorithms but the best one was selected using the cross validation technique.

** build the app
